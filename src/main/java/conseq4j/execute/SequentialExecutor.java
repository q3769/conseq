/**
 * Main API of conseq executor, bypassing the intermediate
 * ({@link java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService}) API, to service the submitted task per its
 * sequence key.
 *
 * <p>A public implementation should be thread-safe. In the context of asynchronous concurrency and
 * sequencing, thread-safety goes beyond the concerns of data corruption due to concurrent
 * modification, into that of execution order across multiple tasks. By definition, though, there is
 * no such thing as order or sequence among tasks submitted concurrently by different threads. Such
 * multi-thread submitted tasks can be executed in any order, regardless of sequence key. However,
 * tasks submitted by a single thread - or, by each single thread in a multi-threading scenario -
 * should be executed sequentially in the same order of submission if they have the same sequence
 * key; otherwise, such single-thread submitted tasks should be managed to execute concurrently by
 * multiple threads if they have different sequence keys.

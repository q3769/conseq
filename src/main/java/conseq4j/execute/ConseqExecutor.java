     * Tasks of different sequence keys execute in parallel, pending thread availability from the backing
     * {@link #workerExecutorService}.
     * <p>
     * Sequential execution of tasks under the same/equal sequence key is achieved by linearly chaining/queuing the
     * task/work stages of the same key, leveraging the {@link CompletableFuture} API.
     * <p>
     * A {@link ConcurrentMap} is employed to keep track of each sequence key's pending tasks status. Each map entry
     * represents an active sequential executor in-service for all the tasks under the same sequence key; the entry's
     * value is to hold the most recently added task as the tail of the FIFO task queue of the active executor. With
     * this executor map, an active executor can be located by its sequence key so that a subsequent task of the same
     * key can be queued/chained behind the previous task. If no active executor exists in the map for the submitted
     * task's sequence key, a new entry/executor will be created. Before added to the tail of the task queue, each task
     * will be converted to a new corresponding work stage (of type {@link CompletableFuture}). If there already exists
     * an entry/work stage of the same sequence key in the map, the current work stage will be chained to execute behind
     * the existing work stage and replace the existing stage as the tail of the task queue in the map entry. This new
     * work stage will not start executing before the previous stage completes, and will have to finish executing before
     * the next task's work stage can start executing. Such linear progression of the work tasks/stages ensures the
     * sequential-ness of task execution under the same sequence key.
     * <p>
     * A separate administrative task/stage is triggered to run at the completion of each work task/stage. Under the
     * same sequence key, this admin task will locate the executor entry in the map, and remove the entry if its work
     * stage is complete. Otherwise, if the work stage is not complete, the admin task does nothing; the incomplete work
     * stage stays in the map under the same sequence key, ready to be trailed by the next work stage. This
     * administration ensures that every executor entry ever put on the map is eventually cleaned up and removed as long
     * as every work stage runs to complete. Although always chained after the completion of a work stage, the admin
     * task/stage is never added to the task work queue on the executor map and has no effect on the overall
     * sequential-ness of the work stage executions.
     *
     * @param task
     *         the task to be called asynchronously with proper sequence
     * @param sequenceKey
